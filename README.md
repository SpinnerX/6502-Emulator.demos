# 6502 Emulator Demos (Early Prototypes)


## Overview
This repository will have folders containing demos, and any prototypes related to the topics of \
folders they are located in. Demos and Protype are to demonstrate ideas that will be considered using \
for the 6502 emulators renderer. Including notes, ideas, and considerations that will be part of core use of the \
renderer. Whole point of this repository is to keep track of ideas, features part of the renderer that'll be utilized \
through the core applications. Some things may involve parallel processing in sending data from one application to the \
other. In this repository, I will also be listing in an orderly fashion of how I am also going to be prioritizing tasks, \
and features regarding the renderer (and the emulator).

## One Thing I'd like to Note
Goal of the renderer is to utilize the Opengl, glew, glut, and freeglut frameworks. This way we have full control of how we may \
want things to render. Including having our own implementations of certain applications. Giving us that flexibility for the time being \
and to allow us figure some graphhics optimization (if any discovered, may be in their own directories part of this repository).

## NOTE (To self, and the viewers)
For right now, since there are quite a lot to do still, this repo will will remain, until we get to a point where issues start \
being a thing. Meaning that since, the 6502 Emulator is in still the early phase, with much to do. There are considerable amount of time \
needed to look at how the 6502 works, from hardware working with software. Including handling external devices connections, and etc.
